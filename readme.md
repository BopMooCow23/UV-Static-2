### Disclamer
We take no credit for the making of Ultraviolet. Ultraviolet is made by Titanium Network, and therefore isn't ours. <br>
Cody's Shack uses TIW's static version of Ultraviolet and a custom Bare server to run. We are not taking credit for Bare or TIW's static version of Ultraviolet.<br>
Want to make your own proxy built off of Cody's Shack? Feel free to! Just make sure to credit me (after all, I didn't get paid for making this) :)
